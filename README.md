# Project Name: AppoVate
Showcase Your Apps with Style

## Overview
**AppoVate** is a modern web application built with React.js for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end. It showcases apps developed by the company Appovate, offering a real app store-like experience. Users can browse featured/trending apps, use live search, and simulate installing/uninstalling apps. Now, with the addition of a backend, app data is fetched from a MongoDB database, providing real-time updates and improved scalability
